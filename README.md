## SDLC based implementation of Battleships game
   
  A simple implementation of the classic Batleships game. There is a grid of 10x10. There are 5 ships in total.
#### The dimensions are
Ship size  |Number of ships 
-----------|---------------
2          |2           
3          |1           
4          |1           
6          |1           

The computer places all the ships at random in any orientation. The player has to hit all the ships (guess the location of all the ships). Correct hit will be denoted as 'x', miss hit will be denoted as 'o'.
##### Note:
Image shown below is a reference and has more ships and miss hit is indicated by 'x'.
